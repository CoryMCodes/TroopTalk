# TroopTalk

TroopTalk is a full-stack web application built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack. It allows users to create and join groups to engage in discussions on various topics of interest. Users can create new groups, join existing groups, and make posts within the groups. Additionally, users have the ability to search for specific groups, connect with other users, and share content such as picture, videos and stories.
